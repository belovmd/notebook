    "* Shared memory - makes access to state from another context easier\n",
    "* Lightweight - low memory footprint\n",
    "* Allows you to easily make responsive UIs\n",
    "* cPython C extension modules that properly release the GIL will run in parallel\n",
    "* Great option for I/O-bound applications\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cons\n",
    "* cPython - subject to the GIL\n",
    "* Not interruptible/killable\n",
    "* If not following a command queue/message pump model (using the Queue module), then manual use of synchronization primitives become a necessity (decisions are needed for the granularity of locking)\n",
    "* Code is usually harder to understand and to get right - the potential for race conditions increases dramatically\n"

This simplifies the CPython implementation by making the object model (including critical built-in types such as dict) implicitly safe against concurrent access. Locking the entire interpreter makes it easier for the interpreter to be multi-threaded, at the expense of much of the parallelism afforded by multi-processor machines.\n",

It is believed that overcoming this performance issue would make the implementation much more complicated and therefore costlier to maintain.\n",
